# Irish Climbing Experience
The aim of this project is to create a responsive website for an indoor climbing gym Irish Climbing Experience (ICE). The idea for this website came from a conversation with some climbers who expressed frustration because they didnâ€™t have any facility where they could train during the winter months.
Irish Climbing Experience is designed to be the hub of climbing in the north west of Ireland. With the sport of climbing gaining in popularity and in 2021 being the first year for climbing to be included in the Olympic Games, ICE is set on inspiring climbers and to create a new generation of climbers in Ireland. 

# UX 
Users of this website will need an easy to navigate site which guides them to the information they are looking. It should inform users of the facilities which ICE offers as well as information on prices, opening times and booking. This website satisfies these needs and more by having a navigation bar which informs the user what page they are currently on as well as linking to the other pages that they might be looking for. The use of images which relate to what the climbing gym looks like give the user an idea of the facilities, walls and some of the equipment that the will be using when they come to the gym.

## Site Demographic
___
-	Climbers live/travel to the north west of Ireland.
-	Families
-	Couples/Friends
-	People looking for adventure.
-	People who are interested in the sport.
-	Team building groups.
-	Physically active people.
-	Problem Solvers

# Design

## Colours
 The colours that I chose to use in this site were taken from coolors.co. I used an orange and a bright blue because I wanted to use colours which envoke playfulness and friendliness in the users of the site. In both the Navigation Bar and Footer i used a darker navy/black which adds contrast for the white font.
 
  I tried to use the colours in a consistant and logical way by having:
  - All buttons and links in Blue 
  - All large paragraphs in Orange
  - Navigation and Footer in Navy/Black

![Color Pallet Used](docs/features/color-pallet.jpg)

## Images
The images I decided to use in this site all came from unsplash.com. I wanted the images used to have similar colours in them as the colour scheme that I had chosen. This is to make the site feel more cohesive and and to emphasise the companys brand colours.

### HTML Validation
___
I used [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate HTML on each page.


Initally I recieved 3 errors:
1. Error 1: "Element "div" not allowed as child of element "ul" in this context."

Fix: I fixed This error by changing the "btn-group" from a "div" to a "li".

2. Error 2: "Bad value # for attribute method on element form."

Fix: I simply fixed this error by removing the method in the form tag since it is not needed for this project.

3. Error 3: "Attribute type not allowed on element textarea at this point."

Fix: I fixed this error by removing "type="text" attribute from the textarea element.

After I addressed these issues all pages passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

- Home

![Home No Errors](docs/testing/home-no-error.jpg)

- First Time

![First Time No Errors](docs/testing/first-time-no-errors.jpg)

- Facilities

![Facilities No Errors](docs/testing/facilities-no-error.jpg)

- Contact

![contact No Errors](docs/testing/contact-no-error.jpg)

- Facilities



![Facilities No Errors](docs/testing/facilities-no-error.jpg)

### CSS Validation
___
I used [Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS.

My CSS came back with No Errors Found.
![CSS No Errors](docs/testing/css-no-errors.jpg)

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

### Lighthouse Testing

![Lighthouse Score](docs/testing/lighthouse-score.jpg)

### Responsiveness
Throughout this project I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to see how responsive the site was as I built it.
Once I deployed the project I used all devices available to me to see how the site worked on each one.
The devices included:
- Lenovo Ideapad C340
- Huawei P30 Pro
- iPad
- iPhone 8+


# Bugs in Development
Bug - On all pages I had a horizontal scroll bar.
Fix - To fix this I referenced Stack Overflow where I learned to add "overflow: hidden;" to the "body" in CSS.

Bug - When viewed on a tablet the Come Find Us section wasnt responsive.
Fix - To solve this issue I referenced Code Institute lesson on creating the footer in the Resume project. I was reminded to add "class-"col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4"" to all three divs. This pushed the waiver down to a new line and put the other two divs in two col-6 on the same line.

Bug- On the Facilities pageI had trouble with two images streching on large screen sizes.
Fix - I referenced Stack Overflow and learned about "Object-fit: cover;" This has helped the image from streching too much.

Bug - Dropdown navigation menu was too hard to read on small screen sizes due to a transparent background.
Fix - To solve this problem I added a media qurey for a dark background on .navbar-collapse.

Bug - I felt that there was too many Booking buttons in the home page. When the navigation menu dropped down I felt that the buttons were too close.
Fix - I added a media query so that the Booking button in the navbar on only the Home Page would be removed. 

Bug - The Booking modal on mobiles had no way of being dismissed unless it was filled out and confirmed.
Fix - To fox this I changed the Reset Button to a Close Button so users could escape from the booking modal if they didnt want to fill out the form.

Bug - The white text on the Hero image was a little difficult to read on certain pages. 
Fix - I fixed this by adding an opaque overlay on top of each image. This increased contrast and made the text easier to read.

Bug - U

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
