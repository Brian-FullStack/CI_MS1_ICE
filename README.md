# Irish Climbing Experience (MS1)
The aim of this project is to create a responsive website for an indoor climbing gym Irish Climbing Experience (ICE). The idea for this website came from a conversation with some climbers who expressed frustration because they didn’t have any facility where they could train during the winter months.
Irish Climbing Experience is designed to be the hub of climbing in the north west of Ireland. With the sport of climbing gaining in popularity and in 2021 being the first year for climbing to be included in the Olympic Games, ICE is set on inspiring climbers and to create a new generation of climbers in Ireland. 

## UX 
Users of this website will need an easy to navigate site which guides them to the information they are looking. It should inform users of the facilities which ICE offers as well as information on prices, opening times and booking. This website satisfies these needs and more by having a navigation bar which informs the user what page they are currently on as well as linking to the other pages that they might be looking for. The use of images which relate to what the climbing gym looks like give the user an idea of the facilities, walls and some of the equipment that the will be using when they come to the gym.
The people who will utilise this website are:
-	Climbers live/travel to the north west of Ireland.
-	Families
-	Couples/Friends
-	People looking for adventure.
-	People who are interested in the sport.
-	Team building groups.
-	Physically active people.
-	Problem Solvers

# Features

## Common Features
There are two common features which appear on every page.

### HTML Validation
I used [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate HTML on each page.

- First Time

Initally I recieved 3 errors:
1. Error 1: "Element "div" not allowed as child of element "ul" in this context."

Fix: I fixed This error by changing the "btn-group" from a "div" to a "li".

2. Error 2: "Bad value # for attribute method on element form."

Fix: I simply fixed this error by removing the method in the form tag since it is not needed for this project.

3. Error 3: "Attribute type not allowed on element textarea at this point."

Fix: I fixed this error by removing "type="text" attribute from the textarea element.

After I addressed these issues this page passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

![First Time No Errors](docs/testing/first-time-no-errors.jpg)

### CSS Validation
I used [Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS.

My CSS came back with No Errors Found.
![CSS No Errors](docs/testing/css-no-errors.jpg)

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

I deployed this website using GitHub pages. The process I used is as follows:
1. I logged into my Github account and selected my MS1 project from my repositories.
2. I clicked on 'Settings' in the repository.
3. In the menu on the left i clicked on 'Pages'.
4. I then clicked on 'Source'.
5. I clicked on the dropdown menu that said 'None' and then selected 'Main'.
6. After the page reloaded I clicked on the link to the deployed site.

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
