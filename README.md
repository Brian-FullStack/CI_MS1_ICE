# Irish Climbing Experience (MS1)
The aim of this project is to create a responsive website for an indoor climbing gym Irish Climbing Experience (ICE). The idea for this website came from a conversation with some climbers who expressed frustration because they didn’t have any facility where they could train during the winter months.
Irish Climbing Experience is designed to be the hub of climbing in the north west of Ireland. With the sport of climbing gaining in popularity and in 2021 being the first year for climbing to be included in the Olympic Games, ICE is set on inspiring climbers and to create a new generation of climbers in Ireland. 

## UX 
Users of this website will need an easy to navigate site which guides them to the information they are looking. It should inform users of the facilities which ICE offers as well as information on prices, opening times and booking. This website satisfies these needs and more by having a navigation bar which informs the user what page they are currently on as well as linking to the other pages that they might be looking for. The use of images which relate to what the climbing gym looks like give the user an idea of the facilities, walls and some of the equipment that the will be using when they come to the gym.
The people who will utilise this website are:
-	Climbers live/travel to the north west of Ireland.
-	Families
-	Couples/Friends
-	People looking for adventure.
-	People who are interested in the sport.
-	Team building groups.
-	Physically active people.
-	Problem Solvers

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- In the future I would like to implement a members Log In page for gym members.
- I would like to add the colour coded grading chart used for specifing the route grade in the climbing gym.

## Validations

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

I deployed this website using GitHub pages. The process I used is as follows:
1. I logged into my Github account and selected my MS1 project from my repositories.
2. I clicked on 'Settings' in the repository.
3. In the menu on the left i clicked on 'Pages'.
4. I then clicked on 'Source'.
5. I clicked on the dropdown menu that said 'None' and then selected 'Main'.
6. After the page reloaded I clicked on the link to the deployed site.

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
